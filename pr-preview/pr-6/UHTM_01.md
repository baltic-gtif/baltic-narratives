# Urban Heat Trend Monitor
Urban heat islands reduce the quality of life in cities. To counteract this, urban planners need to know where heat islands occur and what measures can be taken to reduce their impact on citizens. In addition, it is important to be able to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of measures that have already been introduced and to adjust where necessary.

The **Urban Heat Trend Monitoring** Service combines data from ESA's Copernicus Sentinel 2 and 3 satellites with Open Street Map features to provide users with easy-to-interpret maps of urban climate information that can be integrated into administrative processes and facilitate sustainable urban planning. Super-resolution imaging is used to enhance the resolution of the satellite instruments to a scale of 100 metres allowing the analysis of heat islands and temperature fluctuations at the level of individual neighbourhoods
